    To run web applications,you need a web server.
    A web server is software that serves files in
    response
    to requests from web browsers.
     A web server is sometimes called an HTTP
    server.
    Common web servers include IIS,
    Netscape Enterprise Server, iPlanet Web Server,
    and Apache HTTP Server.
     If youâ€™re not using a web hosting service,
    choose a web server and
    install it on your local computer
    or on a remote computer
